# **Tasks.md: ArXiv Scraper Project**

## **Frontend**
### 1. **Set Up Streamlit UI**
   - Design and implement the basic layout of the Streamlit frontend.
   - Add a search bar for users to input search terms.
   - Display search results (paper titles, authors, abstracts, and links to ArXiv) in a user-friendly format.
   - Ensure the frontend is responsive and easy to navigate.

### 2. **Integrate with Backend API**
   - Set up API calls from Streamlit to the backend (`GET /search?query=<search_term>`).
   - Handle the API response and display the relevant data on the frontend.
   - Implement error handling in case of no results or API failures.

### 3. **Improve User Experience**
   - Add loading spinners or messages while waiting for API responses.
   - Implement pagination if the results are too many.
   - Add an option to filter search results by categories or publication date (optional).

## **Backend**
### 1. **Set Up FastAPI/Flask Backend**
   - Initialize the backend with FastAPI or Flask.
   - Set up the API endpoint (`GET /search?query=<search_term>`) to fetch data from the ArXiv API.
   - Implement parsing and formatting of ArXiv response data (title, authors, abstract, etc.).

### 2. **Fetch Data from ArXiv API**
   - Write a function to send search queries to the ArXiv API.
   - Ensure proper handling of API rate limits and errors.
   - Implement logic to process the API response and structure it for the frontend.

### 3. **Implement API Response Format**
   - Format the data as JSON with fields for title, authors, abstract, and URL.
   - Ensure the response format is consistent and easy for the frontend to parse.

## **Deployment**
### 1. **Set Up Local Development Environment**
   - Clone the repository and install dependencies.
   - Ensure that both frontend (Streamlit) and backend (FastAPI/Flask) run locally.
   - Test the local setup to ensure proper communication between the frontend and backend.

### 2. **Configure Deployment Environment**
   - Set up a production deployment (e.g., Heroku, AWS, etc.).
   - Ensure both frontend and backend are deployed and accessible via the web.
   - Implement a simple `README` for the deployment process.

## **Enhancements and Future Features**
### 1. **Implement Caching for Performance**
   - Investigate options for caching search results (e.g., in-memory or a simple caching solution) to improve performance for repeated searches.
   - Implement cache expiration to ensure data freshness.

### 2. **Improve Search Functionality**
   - Add advanced search features like filtering by categories or date ranges.
   - Implement search ranking based on relevance or other criteria.

### 3. **Expand Frontend Features**
   - Add pagination to results for handling large datasets.
   - Allow users to save papers they are interested in for future reference (temporary session storage).
   - Include a “View More” option for abstracts to avoid clutter on the UI.

---

## **Testing**
### 1. **Write Unit Tests**
   - Create unit tests for both the frontend (Streamlit) and backend (FastAPI/Flask).
   - Test API functionality (searching, parsing, and data formatting).
   - Ensure the frontend correctly handles edge cases (e.g., no results, API failures).

### 2. **Test Deployment**
   - Perform end-to-end tests to ensure that both frontend and backend are working as expected in the deployed environment.
   - Test on different devices and browsers to ensure cross-compatibility.

---

## **Documentation**
### 1. **Update README**
   - Provide detailed instructions for setting up the project locally and deploying it.
   - Add any new features or changes to the project documentation.

### 2. **Create Detailed API Documentation**
   - Document all API endpoints, including expected input, output, and error codes.
   - Add examples for how to interact with the API.

## **License and Legal**
### 1. **Confirm MIT License**
   - Double-check that the project complies with the MIT License.
   - Ensure the necessary attributions are in place for any external libraries or resources used.
