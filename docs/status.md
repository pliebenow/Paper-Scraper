# **Status.md: ArXiv Scraper Project**

## **Current Status**
- ✅ Initial project setup complete
- ✅ Basic scraper structure implemented
- ✅ ArXiv API integration complete
- ✅ Testing suite implemented
- ✅ Frontend development complete
- ⬜️ Backend API implementation
- ⬜️ Deployment setup

## **Completed Tasks**
- Created project structure and documentation
- Implemented base PaperScraper class with error handling
- Defined PaperMetadata data structure
- Implemented ArXiv-specific scraper with:
  - Paper search functionality
  - Single paper retrieval by ID
  - Rate limiting and error handling
  - Date range filtering support
  - Advanced sorting capabilities:
    - Date-based sorting using ArXiv API
    - Author and title sorting
    - Ascending/descending options
    - Hybrid sorting approach (API + client-side)
- Added comprehensive test suite:
  - Unit tests for ArXiv scraper
  - Async test support
  - Test fixtures and configurations
  - Error case coverage
- Implemented Streamlit frontend:
  - Search interface with customizable results
  - Date range filtering (earliest to latest)
  - Flexible sorting options:
    - Sort by date, authors, or title
    - Ascending/descending order control
  - Paper display with expandable sections
  - Direct links to ArXiv and PDFs
  - Responsive layout
  - Search tips and documentation
  - Loading states and error handling
  - Input validation
- Fixed async/sync implementation in ArXiv scraper
- Updated project dependencies

## **In Progress**
- Setting up FastAPI backend endpoints
- Planning deployment strategy

## **Next Steps**
1. Implement FastAPI backend endpoints
2. Set up deployment configuration
3. Add additional features:
   - PDF downloading
   - Extended search parameters
   - Caching layer
   - Multiple criteria sorting
4. Expand test coverage:
   - Integration tests
   - Performance tests
   - Mock tests for API calls
   - Sorting functionality tests
5. Frontend enhancements:
   - Advanced search filters
   - Paper comparison features
   - Date preset selections (last week, month, year)
   - Additional sorting criteria

## **Known Issues**
- None reported yet

## **Timeline**
- Project Start: [Current Date]
- Expected MVP: [Current Date + 2 weeks]

## **Notes**
- Project is following a stateless architecture as specified
- Using Python with FastAPI for backend
- Frontend implemented using Streamlit
- ArXiv API integration includes rate limiting (3 seconds between requests)
- Test suite uses pytest with async support
- Frontend provides intuitive paper search with date filtering and sorting
- Hybrid sorting approach optimizes performance by using ArXiv API when possible

## **Dependencies & Setup**
- **Frontend**: Streamlit
- **Backend**: FastAPI or Flask
- **Data Source**: ArXiv API
- **Deployment**: Local development setup first, with potential for deployment to Heroku or AWS.

## **Challenges & Considerations**
- Need to decide on the choice of **FastAPI** or **Flask** for the backend.
- Will require good error handling for API rate limits and response parsing.
- Consider caching strategies for performance enhancements in the future.

## **Planned Start Date**
- **Development Start Date**: TBD
